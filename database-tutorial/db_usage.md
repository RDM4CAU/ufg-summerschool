## Install and usage of a database
<section>
In this section you will learn how to **install** *SQLiteStudio*, **create** your first very own *database* and **add** some *tables* with different *columns*.

In our example we are using SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and the SQLiteStudio (https://sqlitestudio.pl/). You can download a version for your Linux, Mac or Windows system here (https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio/releases). There is a variety of software to manage databases (DBMS), but we chose this one because of it's very visual interface.
**Follow the instructions of the installer and open the client after you're done.**

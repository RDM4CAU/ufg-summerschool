## Instalation and usage of a database

In this section you will learn how to install SQLiteStudio, create your first very own database and add some tables with different columns.

In our example we are using SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and the SQLiteStudio (https://sqlitestudio.pl/). You can download a version for your Linux, Mac or Windows system here (https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio/releases). Follow the instructions of the installer and open the client after you're done.

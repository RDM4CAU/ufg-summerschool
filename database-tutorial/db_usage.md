## Install and usage of a database
<section>
In this section you will learn how to **install** *SQLiteStudio*, **create** your first very own *database*, **add** some *tables* with different *columns*, **import** and **export** some data into them. These are some of the basics of using databases, after that you should be able to use it but there is still a lot to learn!

In our example we are using SQLite (https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and the SQLiteStudio (https://sqlitestudio.pl/). You can download a version for your Linux, Mac or Windows system here (https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio/releases). There is a variety of software to manage databases (DBMS), but we chose this one because of it's very visual interface.
**Follow the instructions of the installer and open the client after you're done.**

### Creating a database, tables and columns
<section>

#### First step is to create a database file:

* click on **add a database**
* select SQLite 3
* create an .db3 file with a name and folder of your choice

#### Create tables for your data

* click on **create a table**
* add a name for your table
* click on **create a column**
* add a primary key (-> configure autoincrement)
* Now you can add columns that suite your data. If you already have a structure i.e. from a spreadsheet, you can use that for your db modelling. *Be careful about the datatypes, constraints and indexes before you finalize your database!*

### Enter data into your database (manual and csv import)

Manual entry:

* Click under *data* on **Insert row**, click into fields and enter your data.
* You can also design a form under *Form view*.

Import csv:

* Click on **Import** and select your database and table.
* Select your data type, your .csv file and the encoding (UTF8 is best). Also you can select the data separator and check if your data has a header. Then you can click the finish-button and your data gets imported.
